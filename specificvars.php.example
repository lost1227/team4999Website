/*
The user is sent to slack, and slack returns information about the user. If the user is a member of the frcteam4999 workspace If they match, then the user has the LoggedIn flag set to true on their session.
Then the user is allowed to use the $DBUser and $DBPass to view and change the scouting information.
Users who have logged in will have their name and userid stored, in the $LoginTableName. Admins are users who have the admin field set to true in this table.

The login table will have the following schema: (name VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, userid VARCHAR(255), admin BOOLEAN)

The TeamDataTable will associate teams with robotids. It will have the following schema:
(number INTEGER NOT NULL, robotids VARCHAR(255), eventids VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY `team_index` (number))

The RobotDataTable will hold random key-value pairs for storing variable data. It will have the following schema:
(robotid VARCHAR(255), data_key VARCHAR(255), data_value TEXT, PRIMARY KEY `robotid_index` (robotid, data_key))

The EventDataTable will hold varying key-value pairs and associates them with an eventid. This will hold info on a match the team has competed in. It has this schema:
(eventid VARCHAR(255), data_key VARCHAR(255), data_value TEXT, PRIMARY KEY `eventid_index` (eventid, data_key))

There will be a JSON file (schema.json) describing the schema of the data to collect for each year's robot
