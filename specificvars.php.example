/*
The user's username and password are checked against the database to see if they match. If they match, then the user has the LoggedIn flag set to true on their session.
This causes createDBObject to check the user's username and password in the $LoginTableName, and if it is correct, the user is allowed to use the $DBUser and $DBPass to view and change the scouting information.

The login table will have the following schema: (user VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, passhash TEXT, name TEXT, admin BOOLEAN, INDEX `user_index` (user))

$TableTable is the name of a table with the following schema: (table_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, json_columns TEXT, selected BOOLEAN, INDEX `table_index` (table_name))
It defines a list of other tables in the database. table_name is the name of the table. json_columns is a json-formatted description of the table's columns (see example below). selected is a boolean, describing if the table is the table being currently shown
