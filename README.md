#SQL Database access
If you need access to the database, tell me on slack and I'll create a user account for your needs.
The database is managed at https://frcteam4999.jordanpowers.net/phpmyadmin/.
The user account "test" with password "1234567890" temporarily allows read and write access to the database, for development purposes. When the website is complete, the user account will be revoked.

#Error Logs
Error logs can be accessed at https://frcteam4999.jordanpowers.net/logs/error.log. This is userful for debugging php.
The error logs are cleared nightly.
